# PipeGuide
"Mastering the art of cylindrical flight models, one pipe at a time."

**PipeGuide** is a powerful tool designed to assist FlightGear and YASim developers in transforming 3D aircraft fuselage models into YASim-compatible fuselage sections. While YASim requires fuselages to be represented as simple cylindrical shapes, aircraft fuselages are rarely perfect cylinders. **PipeGuide** addresses this discrepancy by refining these cylindrical representations to produce realistic and aerodynamic fuselage profiles.

## Overview

The challenge of flight model development often involves adapting detailed 3D aircraft designs to the simplified cylindrical shapes required by YASim. **PipeGuide** helps bridge this gap by dividing your fuselage model into three distinct sections—upper, middle, and lower. This segmentation allows the tool to more accurately follow the aircraft’s original dimensions and shape.

The output generated by **PipeGuide** includes a refined cylindrical fuselage model that can be integrated into an existing YASim flight model. This tool automates the process of aligning, tapering, and smoothing these cylindrical sections, making it easier for developers to create accurate and functional flight models.

## Features

- **Effortless Model Import**: Load your 3D fuselage models with ease.
- **Accurate Sectioning**: Divide the fuselage into upper, middle, and lower sections to closely match the original shape.
- **Refined Tapering**: Automatically adjust and align cylindrical sections for a more realistic fuselage profile.
- **Advanced Smoothing**: Apply Bessel filters to smooth contours and improve aerodynamic accuracy.
- **YASim XML Output**: Generate XML data for the fuselage that can be integrated into an existing flight model.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip3 install numpy pyvista scipy
```

## Usage

Execute PipeGuide from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python3 pipeguide.py [input_file] [options]
```

### Arguments

- `input_file`: Path to the 3D fuselage model file (required).
- `-s`, `--sections`: Number of cylindrical sections to divide the model into (default: 83).
- `-f`, `--filter-order`: Order of the Bessel filter used for smoothing (default: 6).
- `-c`, `--filter-cutoff`: Cutoff frequency for the Bessel filter (default: 0.12).
- `-o`, `--output-file`: Path for the output XML file (default: `yasim.xml`).
- `-w`, `--width-axis`: Axis to use for width calculation (`x`, `y`, or `z`, default: `z`).
- `-t`, `--triple-mode`: Process and refine upper, middle, and lower sections separately for better shape adherence.

### Example

```bash
python3 pipeguide.py fuselage_model.obj -o refined_fuselage.xml -t
```

## Technical Insights

**PipeGuide** uses several advanced techniques to process and refine cylindrical fuselage models:

1. **Model Importation and Sectioning**: Load your 3D fuselage model and divide it into upper, middle, and lower sections. This separation allows for a more accurate representation of complex fuselage shapes by handling each part individually.

2. **Sectional Analysis and Tapering**: Analyze and adjust each section to align with the aircraft’s real-world dimensions. The tool refines the cylindrical segments to closely match the original fuselage profile.

3. **Centroid and Width Calculation**: Calculate the centroid and width for each section to guide the tapering and alignment process.

4. **Bessel Smoothing**: Apply Bessel filters to smooth the contours of the fuselage, enhancing aerodynamic accuracy and overall realism.

5. **XML Generation**: Produce an XML file with the refined fuselage data. This file contains only the fuselage sections, which developers can integrate into an existing flight model file.

Certainly! Here’s a separate section for your README.md addressing the coordinate system requirements and model preparation instructions:

## Coordinate System and Model Preparation

### Coordinate System

For **PipeGuide** to process your fuselage model accurately, the input model must adhere to the FlightGear coordinate system:

- **x**: + forwards / - backwards
- **y**: + left / - right
- **z**: + up / - down

Ensure that your model is oriented according to this coordinate system before using **PipeGuide**. If your model does not conform to this coordinate system, the results may not be as expected.

### Preparing Your Model

If your model is not in the FlightGear coordinate system, you may need to adjust its orientation. Here are some general steps to prepare your model:

1. **Use a 3D Modeling Software**: Open your model in a 3D modeling software that supports coordinate system adjustments, such as Blender, Autodesk Maya, or 3ds Max.

2. **Align the Coordinate System**:
   - **Blender**: You can rotate your model to match the FlightGear coordinate system by using the `Transform` options. Rotate the model so that:
     - The positive x-axis points forwards.
     - The positive y-axis points left.
     - The positive z-axis points up.
   - **Autodesk Maya** or **3ds Max**: Adjust the model's orientation using the `Rotate` tool to align the axes accordingly.

3. **Check Model Orientation**: Ensure that the model's bounding box aligns with the FlightGear coordinate system. This can often be visualized in the modeling software's viewport.

4. **Export in Supported Format**: Save or export the model in a format supported by **pyvista**. **PipeGuide** currently supports the following formats:
   - **OBJ** (.obj)
   - **STL** (.stl)
   - **PLY** (.ply)

   Make sure the exported model file adheres to the correct coordinate system and is in a compatible format.

### Additional Notes

- **Scaling**: Ensure that the scale of the model is consistent with your flight model requirements. The tool does not perform scaling adjustments.
- **Model Integrity**: Verify that your model is a closed mesh with no errors or inconsistencies, as these can affect the sectioning and analysis process.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your fuselage model is correctly prepared and aligned for accurate processing by **PipeGuide**.
